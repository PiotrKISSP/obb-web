## What this app is about
This application allows vet to store and modify animal research data. It's main purpose is to replace spreadsheets and store data in the cloud. Additionally, the application has an authentication system ensuring data protection, the ability to generate PDF and possibility to check data on the interactive charts.

## How can I install this app
At this moment application is hosted on the [obb-sys](https://obb-sys.netlify.app) website, but in case you want to use it locally, all you have to do is to install current LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and pass into your terminal (inside app directory) two commends:

### `npm install`

Installs all dependencies needed to run Obb-Sys app. <br />In case of outdated dependencies, try to run `npm audit fix`. <br />I'm trying to fix such things as fast as possible, but sometimes it just takes a while. 
<br />Most of times app is going to work even after error messages calling to use `audit` option <br />(not the ones that say you couldn't install dependencies - in case of such errors, check your internet connection). 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
